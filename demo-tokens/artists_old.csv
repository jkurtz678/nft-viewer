Isabella Addison,,,War Girl,"Half girl, half war machine. The representation of women feeling obligated to fit into a mold to be accepted. War Girl embodies the strength to break free of that mold and look to the future with open eyes and excitement. I moved to Los Angeles at the beginning of 2021, couch surfing until I got the car that I lived out of. I created War Girl in different places along my journey. She gave me the power to push my life forward. Web 3 gave me a home when I didn’t have one, allowing me to create anything I want without limitations.",https://foundation.app/@isabellaaddison/foundation/131128,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_FmJILMgxJIvTx15d3yndeRELVKTuyH2/view,Foundation,16:9,,,Needs to be rotated,,
Isabella Addison,,,Aiko,"Isabella Addison started her artistic journey in South Florida where she found love for street art and painting. Now based out of Los Angeles, her work ranges from murals, fine art, digital art, and animations. Her multifaceted artistic identity combines painting and digital art to create a unique cyberpunk aesthetic that tells the story of her narrative series, Disco’s Dead. Addison’s work deals with serious subjects such as technological singularity, augmented reality, and climate change. Her art continues to push forward in the NFT space as the way to construct a community-created and funded cartoon series. Isabella Addison will continue to experiment, combining physical and digital art to tell her stories and bring change.",https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/100939897029051551781619883256248715796355878270825055152392741801508783259649,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XhGU5pZr3rEz3ncWWwf0tRWnif8cQHC3/view,Opensea,16:9,Y,,Needs to be rotated,,isabellaaddisonh@gmail.com
David Oreilley,,,Growth,"This work emerged from exploration into bio-evolution simulation, applying research into the origins of life with the computational abilities of the GPU. We see a multitude of intelligent agents, each a single pixel wide, imprinting themselves into their environment, organically forming relationships as they search for new sources of life. Once a source is depleted, they must move on if they are to survive. This results in a complex, collective behavior in which each life informs the path of every other, making the environment and beings within it one continuous system.",?,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wR-fQDqCgo_uoop79K6bd0Yr3HHKdpQ6,?,,Y,,,,mail@davidoreilly.com
Ash Thorp,,,Degradation,"Degradation is a touchstone moving image work from Ash Thorp that represents a first glimpse into the subject of his next upcoming short film, Evident Mirror. The work and subsequent film are based on a speculative, converging path between artificial intelligence and humanity reaching singularity. Degradation was formed with 500+ independently designed frames seamlessly connected into three looping animations, forming an intersecting triptych. Each frame was carefully designed to not only display a captivating work in motion but to also be enjoyed individually as standalone stills.",https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/proof-sovereignty-curated-nft-sale-lady-pheonix/ash-thorp-b-1983-3/121265,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2837e5pq6z4f970/AABQ8TnbPEnvRnpj2mMyFZuPa?dl=0,,,N,,,,monica@altcinc.com

Aeforia,,,Symbiosis,"Symbiosis, 2021. The entirety of my revenue from the sale of this piece will be donated to The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. Created at the beginning of 2021, “Symbiosis” was a collaborative piece created with the help of my audience on Instagram. By choosing different options they were given, they ended up deciding what the piece would look like. I have been thinking of releasing ""Symbiosis"" as an NFT for a while, but considering the community-driven/collaborative effort behind the artwork, I figured it would be a great opportunity to seal that connection further and donate 100% of all the profits I’d make from the sale to a noble cause. Therefore, I asked for my audience’s input on whom I shall give the proceeds to. The most requested causes were: well-being of children, helping women in difficulty, helping marginalized groups and lastly, the Amazon Rainforest. Considering these causes, I chose these organizations: The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. The majority of the people also decided that we would split the funds equally between the different organizations.

Ada Sokol,,,Luna(r) 3,"When night falls, those nocturnal creatures emerge driven toward light for an unknown reason. Moths are associated with faith & determination. They are adamantly & conscientiously following lunar or artificial light, even at the risk of jeopardizing their lives. On the other hand, the moth is also a symbol of vulnerability & fragility, both in body & mind. While showing us the importance of vigilance & determination, the habits of those nocturnal insects also morally caution us against the self-destructive tendencies of blind faith. The computer parts that Luna stands on create a balance between technical & natural realms and a link to the tools utilized to bring her to digital life. Luna is also the female name derived straight from the Latin word for ""moon"". In ancient Roman mythology, it's a goddess, the divine embodiment of the Moon (with her Greek counterpart being Selene). The very deity is considered a protector of those creatures desperately longing for the moonlight. Luna(r) project was exhibited at several international festivals such as the Porsche SCOPES festival, Dubai EXPO, and Miami Art Basel.",https://zora.co/collections/zora/2030,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Su0bKh7o0VUobxrh1X6VxqHEzONCty2G, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mifRb44WXqV",,,Y,,,,mail@adasokol.com
Ada Sokol,,,"Gaia, 🗝️ N°1: Love","Gaia, 🗝️ N°1: Love: Female values are essential keys to the care of the environment. with sound created by Beatsbyholly ✨ Love begets love, creating descendants who follow in their footsteps. It transcends species while taking on a variety of forms. Leafy sea dragons are some of the most ornately camouflaged creatures on the planet. Just as deepest love, they are sometimes the hardest to notice. Holding the key to the creation & sustainment, which was designed especially for this project, they pay homage to the women who have historically wielded the keys of the household. Gaia series is set as an exploratory endeavor celebrating female strength & values in nature. It highlights three virtues - wisdom, love & health - which are symbolic keys to strengthening our relationship with nature that seems lost in mainstream ethics.","https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/gaia,-%F0%9F%97%9D%EF%B8%8F-n%C2%B01:-love-30348",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cSq9dWm8VQvc7qYTK9rpEY15aCr7jH-L,,,,,,,
Ada Sokol,,,"Gaia, 🔐 N°2: Health ☤","🔐 N°2: Health ☤ In Ancient Greece, the lotus flower represented innocence, modesty, & purity. The lotus represents spiritual enlightenment. Regardless of the state of its environment & the water it's rooted in; the lotus rises above it all to bloom in beauty. This is symbolic of overcoming the material world & emerging from the muddy waters of suffering to reach spiritual enlightenment, thus the health of mind & body. A damselfly flying around the lotus flower is known to be a potent spirit guide. It's a representation of perseverance and purpose, which are a necessity in pursuing one's health. The shape of the key has inspired the caduceus - the contemporary symbol of medicine that originally features two snakes winding around often winged staff. ""H"" at the bottom part of the key stands for ""health"".",?,,,,,,,,
