Ada Sokol,G3,Luna(r) 3,"When night falls, those nocturnal creatures emerge driven toward light for an unknown reason. Moths are associated with faith & determination. They are adamantly & conscientiously following lunar or artificial light, even at the risk of jeopardizing their lives. On the other hand, the moth is also a symbol of vulnerability & fragility, both in body & mind. While showing us the importance of vigilance & determination, the habits of those nocturnal insects also morally caution us against the self-destructive tendencies of blind faith. The computer parts that Luna stands on create a balance between technical & natural realms and a link to the tools utilized to bring her to digital life. Luna is also the female name derived straight from the Latin word for ""moon"". In ancient Roman mythology, it's a goddess, the divine embodiment of the Moon (with her Greek counterpart being Selene). The very deity is considered a protector of those creatures desperately longing for the moonlight. Luna(r) project was exhibited at several international festivals such as the Porsche SCOPES festival, Dubai EXPO, and Miami Art Basel.",https://zora.co/collections/zora/2030,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Su0bKh7o0VUobxrh1X6VxqHEzONCty2G, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mifRb44WXqV",,,Y,,,,mail@adasokol.com

It transcends species while taking on a variety of forms. Leafy sea dragons are some of the most ornately camouflaged creatures on the planet. Just as deepest love, they are sometimes the hardest to notice. Holding the key to the creation & sustainment, which was designed especially for this project, they pay homage to the women who have historically wielded the keys of the household. Gaia series is set as an exploratory endeavor celebrating female strength & values in nature. It highlights three virtues - wisdom, love & health - which are symbolic keys to strengthening our relationship with nature that seems lost in mainstream ethics.","https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/gaia,-%F0%9F%97%9D%EF%B8%8F-n%C2%B01:-love-30348",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cSq9dWm8VQvc7qYTK9rpEY15aCr7jH-L,,,,,,,
Ada Sokol,G3,"Gaia, üîê N¬∞2: Health ‚ò§","üîê N¬∞2: Health ‚ò§ In Ancient Greece, the lotus flower represented innocence, modesty, & purity. The lotus represents spiritual enlightenment. Regardless of the state of its environment & the water it's rooted in; the lotus rises above it all to bloom in beauty. This is symbolic of overcoming the material world & emerging from the muddy waters of suffering to reach spiritual enlightenment, thus the health of mind & body. A damselfly flying around the lotus flower is known to be a potent spirit guide. It's a representation of perseverance and purpose, which are a necessity in pursuing one's health. The shape of the key has inspired the caduceus - the contemporary symbol of medicine that originally features two snakes winding around often winged staff. ""H"" at the bottom part of the key stands for ""health"".",?,,,,,,,,
Aeforia,C5,Symbiosis,"Symbiosis, 2021. The entirety of my revenue from the sale of this piece will be donated to The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. Created at the beginning of 2021, ‚ÄúSymbiosis‚Äù was a collaborative piece created with the help of my audience on Instagram. By choosing different options they were given, they ended up deciding what the piece would look like. I have been thinking of releasing ""Symbiosis"" as an NFT for a while, but considering the community-driven/collaborative effort behind the artwork, I figured it would be a great opportunity to seal that connection further and donate 100% of all the profits I‚Äôd make from the sale to a noble cause. Therefore, I asked for my audience‚Äôs input on whom I shall give the proceeds to. The most requested causes were: well-being of children, helping women in difficulty, helping marginalized groups and lastly, the Amazon Rainforest. Considering these causes, I chose these organizations: The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. The majority of the people also decided that we would split the funds equally between the different organizations.

We see a multitude of intelligent agents, each a single pixel wide, imprinting themselves into their environment, organically forming relationships as they search for new sources of life. Once a source is depleted, they must move on if they are to survive. This results in a complex, collective behavior in which each life informs the path of every other, making the environment and beings within it one continuous system.",?,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wR-fQDqCgo_uoop79K6bd0Yr3HHKdpQ6,?,,Y,,,,mail@davidoreilly.com

Ondrej Zunka,C4,Toxic Exaryum,"Toxic Exaryum is known for its complex scent - its petals smell intensely sweet and musky, almost to a point of smelling artificially chemical, with sour undertones reminiscent of stale, yeasty fermentation. Bulbous growths that develop on the flower‚Äôs stem drop to the earth, releasing acidic compounds into the ground as they decompose. This discourages other species from taking root, turning the surrounding environment barren.",https://www.ondrejzunka.com/the-fleur,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zsx4it8h1xol3d/AAAIVYpsU-YmJZa_3mm9WLnGa/artworks?dl=0&preview=Toxic+Exaryum.jpg&subfolder_nav_tracking=1,,,,,,,
Ondrej Zunka,C4,Transvaal Rubrum,"The twisted stem of the Transvaal Rubrum is a structural alteration simulated by heliotropism. Every day as it grows, the flower cranes towards the sun, and the active movement of this orbital rotation is in a way ‚Äòfrozen‚Äô in time. The spiraling curves of the stem can therefore be seen as a kind of visual history of the plant that trace the paths of the constantly changing direction of the flower. ",https://www.ondrejzunka.com/the-fleur,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zsx4it8h1xol3d/AAAIVYpsU-YmJZa_3mm9WLnGa/artworks?dl=0&preview=Transvaal+Rubrum.jpg&subfolder_nav_tracking=1,,,,,,,
Ondrej Zunka ,C4,Vomitus Flos ,"Vomitus Flos is easily identified by the length of hair that cascades from the inside of the flower‚Äôs receptacle. The hair protects the sensitive stigma, stamen and other reproductive organs by decreasing the amount of light, moisture and dust that they would otherwise be exposed to.",https://www.ondrejzunka.com/the-fleur,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zsx4it8h1xol3d/AAAIVYpsU-YmJZa_3mm9WLnGa/artworks?dl=0&preview=Vomitus+Flos.jpg&subfolder_nav_tracking=1,,,,,,,
